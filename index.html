		        		The LEED green building certification system ushered in a new era of mainstream architecture. 
		        		But in less than two decades after its debut, a more rigorous standard has emerged within the sustainability 
		        		dialogue with the potential to impact not just tomorrow's buildings, but today's as well: net zero energy. 
		        		By balancing a building's energy use against a combination of conservation and renewable energy generation 
		        		strategies so that its net demand on the power grid is zero, this emerging operational standard is a 
		        		challenging metric once thought unattainable. But through precise integration of passive-design principles, 
		        		load-reduction strategies, energy-recovery systems, and onsite renewables, zero energy buildings are moving 
		        		steadily from aspirational to normative.

		        		The General Services Administration (GSA) promotes net zero within the federal construction sector by mandating 
		        		that their buildings reduce fossil fuel generated energy consumption to zero by 2030. The New Buildings Institute (NBI) 
		        		listed 39 verified “zero energy” buildings in 2015, and the International Living Future Institute has conferred net zero 
		        		energy building (NZEB) certification on 27 projects since 2006 (including the Living Buildings and Petal subcategories), 
		        		each of which offers ideas for others to emulate and adapt. Concepts tested in research settings or early one-off projects 
		        		are beginning to migrate into sectors where mass production can help the NZEB idea scale up economically. Many buildings 
		        		not certified as net zero can still be considered “net zero capable” or “net zero ready,” an intermediate category in which 
		        		the addition of renewable energy generation, either on or offsite, would move an otherwise high-performance building up to 
		        		NZEB status. As the field of sustainable design and construction matures, the net zero metric is tangible, and with 
		        		increasing frequency, achievable, particularly as building facade materials and designs make increasing contributions to 
		        		both the conservation and generation sides of the equation.

		        		Although photovoltaics are a potent strategy for boosting the generation side of net energy use, covering an otherwise 
		        		ordinary building with panels will not improve performance as much as careful management of plug loads, solar gain, thermal mass.
